          <h3>Piano</h3>
          <p>A few years ago I started falling in love with this amazing instrument. Started listening to more and more piano recordings and started to think I might learn it someday.</p>
          <p>I questioned myself at first thinking is to late to start and learn to play. I then met an amazing person that pushed me into starting and told me it is never too late.</p>
          <p>So I took the advice, I bought an instrument and started to learn.</p>
          <p>Now I have an amazing piano teacher with whom I learned so much and so fast. </p>
          <p>I can play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxlf-ZmE8JI">pieces</a> that I never dreamt I'll be able to play and I'm so grateful and consider myself so lucky for meeting the persons above.</p>
