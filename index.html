        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="description">I'm an introverted future energy engineer from Romania. I have many hobbies such as playing the piano, designing 3D models, learning about the Universe and listening to music. 
        Lately I've been starting a new hobby, programming and I hope I'll be able to make something beautiful one day.</p>

          <h3>Piano</h3>
          <p>A few years ago I started falling in love with this amazing instrument and started to think I might learn it someday.
          I questioned myself at first thinking is to late to start and learn to play. I then met an amazing person that pushed me into starting.
          So I took the advice.
          Now I have an amazing piano teacher with whom I learned so much.
          I can play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxlf-ZmE8JI">pieces</a> that I never dreamt I'll be able to play and I'm so grateful.</p>

          <h3>3D Modeling</h3>
          <p>This is a hobby I developed in my first year of Uni. I'm still improving since then, I'm learning more programs and I hope that maybe one day I can generate profit from my <a href="https://www.artstation.com/dihelalexandru">projects</a>.</p>
